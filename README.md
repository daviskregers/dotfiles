# My dotfiles

Dotfiles for archlinux with i3wm, alacritty terminal and tmux+neovim.
Mostly used for personal use.

## TODOS:

- [ ] Split apps.sh into multiple functions
- [ ] Set environment specific installs (gpu and battery installs)
- [ ] Add autorandr
- [ ] Add macbook support or split neovim+tmux into seperate repo
