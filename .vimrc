"
" - 1 - open files in a new horizontal split

" Statusline
"
" The statusline can be shown regardless of whether you have more than one
" buffer open with the following setting int your .vimrc
" 
" set laststatus=2
"
" You can disable it by using
"
" set laststatus=0

set laststatus=2

" A very basic statusline can be achieved by adding the following to the vimrc
"
" set statusline=helloWorld
"
" A useful pattern to use when building a statusline is to concatenate the
" line and build the statusline over multiple lines in your vimrc.
"
" set statusline = 
" set statusline += hello
" set statusline += world
"
" - Vimscrip functions
"
"   Statuslines can use Vim functions and it is possible to show anything that
"   can be programmed in Vimscript in the statusline. This might be the
"   weather, the proce of ETH or more commonly the git branch that you are on.
"   The following returns the current branch and an empty string if there is
"   no git repository.
"
"   function! StatuslineGit()
"       let l:branchname = GitBranch()
"       return strlen(l:branchname) > 0?'  '.l:branchname.' ':''
"   endfunction
"
"   set statusline= 
"   set statusline+=%{StatuslineGit()}
"
" - Showing data
"
"   Vim has a number of variables that may be used in statuslines. The `f`
"   character for example shows the path to the file in the buffer and the vim
"   documentation outlines clearly the data that can be shown.
"
"   http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html#'statusline'
"
"   set statusline= 
"   set statusline+=\ %f
"
" - Color
"
"   Color is perhaps the hardest part to configure in statuslines. The
"   documentation (http://docs.huihoo.com/vim/7.2/syntax.html7) is harder 
"   to decipher here but offers the highlight color names that may be used to 
"   change the color of the statusline. 
"
"   These colors are named highlights so it is difficult to understand what the color will
"   be without playing around with them. The syntax using these colors is as
"   follows:
"
"   set statusline= 
"   set statusline+=%#LineNr#
"   set statusline+=\ %f
"
" - A few lines over a plugin reading the documentation and understanding how
"   statuslines work it is easy to construct a statusline that works.
"

function! GitBranch()
  return system("git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null | tr -d '\n'")
endfunction

function! StatuslineGit()
  let l:branchname = GitBranch()
  return strlen(l:branchname) > 0?'  '.l:branchname.' ':''

" Panes:
"
"   You can create a vertical split using `:vsp` and horizontal with `:sp`.
"
"   ```
"   :vsp ~/.vimrc
"   ```
"
"   You can specify the new split height by prefixing with a number:
"
"   ```
"   :10sp ~/.zshrc
"   ```
"
"   Close the split like you would close vim:
"
"   ```
"   :q
"   ```
"
" Easier split navigations:
"
"   We can use different key mappings for easy navigation between splits to
"   save a keystroke. So instead of `ctrl-w` then `j`, it's just `ctrl-j`.
"

" More natural split opening
"
"   Open new plit panes to right and bottom, which feels more natural than
"   Vim's default.

" Resizing splits
"
"   Vims defaults are useful for changing split shapes:
"
"       Max out the height of the current split
"       ctrl + w _
"
"       Max out the width of the current split
"       ctrl + w |
"
"       Normalize all split sizes, which is very handy when resizing terminal
"       ctrl + w =
"
" More split manipulation
"
"   Swap top/bottom or left/right split
"   ctrl + W R
"
"   Break out current window into a new tab
"   Ctrl + W T
"
"   Close every window in the current tab but the current one
"   Ctrl + W o
